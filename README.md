N736 Fall 2017 - Lesson 18 &amp; 19 - Logistic Regression &amp; the Generalized Linear Model

## Lesson 18 - given on Monday October 20, 2017

In this lesson, we will cover the logit function and the basics of logistic regression. We will also cover the basic components of "generalized" linear models including a discussion of the "exponential families" of distributions and their corresponding "canonical link" functions"

See Logistic Regression Overview and Introduction to the Generalized Linear Model at [https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/N736Fall2017_lesson1819/](https://melindahiggins2000.github.io/N736Fall2017_lesson1819/)

## Lesson 19 - given on Wednesday Nov 1, 2017

In this lesson, we will run through a logistic regression exercise (with coded examples in SPSS, SAS and R). I will also show you an initial example of a "generalized" linear model approach for a count variable using Poisson and Negative Binomial Regression.
